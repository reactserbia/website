                        React Serbia serves as a unifying platform for
                        passionate React enthusiasts, striving to empower and
                        elevate their expertise. Our mission is to establish
                        React Serbia as the definitive one-stop destination for
                        the React community in Serbia.

                        <br />
                        Our objective is to establish a robust framework for:
                        <br />‚Ä¢ community growth
                        <br />‚Ä¢ networking opportunities
                        <br />‚Ä¢ exchange of knowledge
                        <br />‚Ä¢ exchange of ideas
                        <br />‚Ä¢ showcasing talent
                        <br />‚Ä¢ job search
                        <br />‚Ä¢ providing the services for the community.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Through this structured approach, we endeavour to create
                        an environment that not only nurtures individual
                        professional development but also contributes
                        significantly to the collective advancement of our
                        community.

                        The organization is open for sponsorship. We will use
                        all the resources we get to enable proper functioning
                        and enjoyable experience.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Organization can be sponsored with the money, of course,
                        but it can be sponsored with the space for the meetups,
                        advertisement material, services, food or anything
                        necessary or benefitial for the organization.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        In the return, sponsors should be showcased as the
                        supporters of the community. Ideally, we should repay
                        sometimes for the help we are receiving. In case of
                        companies, the least we can do is to advertise their
                        current open positions and help them find the right man
                        for the job.

                        <br />
                        Anyone applying for a job ad listed in the
                        organization&apos;s page MUST get a response after
                        applying and explanation in case of a rejection.
                        Everyone deserves a proper treatment and
                        candidate&apos;s effort for the mutual benefit should be
                        appreciated! We value good manners!

                        The organization is financially transparent. People
                        should be able to see the income and outcome lists and
                        see what was done with the money. Everyone should be
                        able to evaluate organization&apos;s work, the way
                        things function and draw a conclustion for themselves
                        whether we are doing a good thing or not.

                        <br />
                        This will be one of the proofs for organization&#39;s
                        legitimacy and whitness about our non-profit nature.

                        The ideas:
                        <br />‚Ä¢ atendees should be registered prior to the
                        meetup in order to properly plan the event
                        <br />‚Ä¢ we will have talks; those can be of a random
                        topics but later we might have the whole event focused
                        on a certain topic
                        <br />‚Ä¢ we will have a panel discussions
                        <br />‚Ä¢ we plan to do workshops
                        <br />‚Ä¢ we will cover non-tech topics, as well
                        <br />‚Ä¢ we will collect the data about atendees and if
                        they&apos;re compliant publish it publicly to show the
                        effort; we can list the people&apos;s socials, GitHub,
                        Twitter, LinkedIn, email, etc.
                        <br />‚Ä¢ we will list the people seeking for a job
