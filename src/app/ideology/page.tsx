                    React enthusiasts, striving to empower and elevate their
                    expertise. Our mission is to establish React Serbia as the
                    definitive one-stop destination for the React community in
                    Serbia.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Our objective is to establish a robust framework for:
                    <br />‚Ä¢ community growth
                    <br />‚Ä¢ networking opportunities
                    <br />‚Ä¢ exchange of knowledge
                    <br />‚Ä¢ exchange of ideas
                    <br />‚Ä¢ showcasing talent
                    <br />‚Ä¢ job search
                    <br />‚Ä¢ providing the services for the community.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Through this structured approach, we endeavour to create an
                    environment that not only nurtures individual professional
                    development but also contributes significantly to the
                    collective advancement of our community.

                <InfoSection heading='Sponsorship üéóÔ∏è'>
                    The organization is open for sponsorship. We will use all
                    the resources we get to enable proper functioning and
                    enjoyable experience.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Organization can be sponsored with the money, of course, but
                    it can be sponsored with the space for the meetups,
                    advertisement material, services, food or anything necessary
                    or benefitial for the organization.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    In the return, sponsors should be showcased as the
                    supporters of the community. Ideally, we should repay
                    sometimes for the help we are receiving. In case of
                    companies, the least we can do is to advertise their current
                    open positions and help them find the right man for the job.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Anyone applying for a job ad listed in the
                    organization&apos;s page MUST get a response after applying
                    and explanation in case of a rejection. Everyone deserves a
                    proper treatment and candidate&apos;s effort for the mutual
                    benefit should be appreciated! We value good manners!
